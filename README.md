# PotassiumES Testing Tools

This is the test framework that we use to test PotassiumES libraries and applications.

The main project page is at [PotassiumES.org](https://potassiumes.org/).

## Project Goals

This repository holds the source code for PotassiumES's front-end application framework. 
**Goal 1:** Enable the wider web

The "wider web" adds augmented and virtual reality to the existing flat web. It incorporates the essential harassment management tools required for healthy social systems.

See [What Is The Wider Web](https://potassiumes.org/wider-web/) for more details.

**Goal 2**: Explore new design, art, and social capabilities

The wider web provides fresh ground to explore new user experience designs, flat graphics, 3D graphics, art forms, and social situations.

This project supports and encourages exploration of these new directions.

## Audience

PotassiumES is for teams who create wider web applications:

- Project managers
- Designers
- Artists
- Writers
- Coders
